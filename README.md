# Hotel HTML

Welcome to Hotel HTML. Staring at a completely unstyled page for years on end does things to a person. Many things, nothing good.
The owner wanted it this way. His attitude remains ever the same: more style means less substance. The rooms are completely unfurnished.
No fixtures, no appliances, no beds, no carpet; just 4 walls and a window. No continental breakfast, no room service, and, to the untrained eye,
no staff. Entering Hotel HTML, instead of a front desk, a Hewlett-Packard of mid 80's vintage sits on the floor in the center of the otherwise empty lobby. A black and white login page is pulled up. Would you like to make a booking?         


##

Hotel HTML allows a customer to log in with a username and password. From there, they can see their past and upcoming room bookings in addition to their total amount of money spent on rooms. They can also navigate to the homepage where they can book new rooms by specifying a date and room type.  

## Setup

Clone this repository down to your local machine. 

Clone [this](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/overlook-api) repository down as well, it's the API where customer, booking and room data are stored and retrieved.

In your terminal, run NPM Install in both folders. Open two terminal tabs, one for the site and one for the API. Run `npm start` in both of your terminal tabs. Go to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see a login page. If that's the case, you're good to go. Enter `control + c` in your terminal to stop the server at any time.

There are 50 users, all usernames are "customerXX" (where "XX" represents a number between 01 and 50). Try out a few passwords, you'll *probably* figure it out after a few tries.
